# UPDATE 9.26.24
I was under the impression that this repo held the finished product of this small game. however, i cannot find the game files anywhere, which includes both the source files and the executable. there may be a flash drive somewhere that has it still, but until then i intend to remake it better than it was before (my programming and overall intelligence has improved in the past 2 years)
# RoboFormer
* game im making
* the goal of this game is to help me advance my programming and game dev skills, not create a cool game (although that's a nice side effect)
